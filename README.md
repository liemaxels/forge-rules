## What Is Forge Rules?

**Forge Rules** is a comprehensive engineering system that combines:

1. **An engineering rulebook** — 25 chapters covering every aspect of building production-grade web applications: architecture, UI/UX, animation, performance, design system, testing, security, accessibility, TypeScript, error handling, mobile, i18n, API design, monitoring, and data visualization.

2. **An AI agent system** — 16 specialized agents that enforce these rules and push any AI model to its highest output quality. Zero AI slop. Every output is production-grade.

3. **Complete workflows** — Battle-tested processes for new features, code reviews, debugging, hotfixes, and team onboarding.

4. **Production templates** — Ready-to-use code scaffolds for components, hooks, services, tests, and entire feature modules.

5. **Quality gates** — Checklists and validation criteria that ensure nothing ships without meeting standards.

---

## Why Use This System?

### The Problem with Traditional AI-Assisted Development

When developers use AI without constraints:
- **Generic, mediocre code** (AI slop) that looks auto-generated
- **No architectural consistency** across files
- **Missing error handling, accessibility, and security**
- **No testing strategy** or quality gates
- **Endless back-and-forth** trying to explain what "good" looks like

### The Forge Rules Solution

```
Traditional AI Development:
Developer → Vague Prompt → AI → Generic Code → Manual Cleanup → Rework
(High cost, medium quality, slow iteration)

Forge Rules Development:
Developer → Specific Agent → Enforced Standards → Production Code → Ship
(Low-medium cost, high quality, fast iteration)
```

### Key Benefits

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **🎯 Enforced Quality** | Every agent has specific rules. No more "make it better" prompts. |
| **⚡ Faster Development** | One developer with agents moves faster than a team of five. |
| **💰 Cost Efficient** | Focused agents = shorter context = cheaper API calls. |
| **🔄 Consistent Output** | Same standards across all files, all features, all developers. |
| **📚 Self-Documenting** | Product Briefs, Architecture docs, Review Reports auto-generated. |
| **🛡️ Built-in Safety** | Security, accessibility, and performance enforced by default. |
| **🔧 Platform Agnostic** | Works with Claude, GPT, Gemini, Kiro, or any AI model. |

### Existing Project Workflow

**Audit and improve an existing codebase:**

```bash
# Step 1: Architecture Audit
Activate: Architect Agent
Prompt: "Audit this codebase against Forge Rules v2.4. 
         Focus on: [specific area like state management, component structure, etc.]"
Output: Audit report with violations and recommendations

# Step 2: Prioritize Fixes
Read the audit report
Sort violations: BLOCKING → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
Create task list for fixes

# Step 3: Fix One File at a Time
Activate: Coder Agent
Prompt: "Refactor [specific file] to comply with Forge Rules"
Input: Paste the relevant rule chapter (e.g., rules/04-component-architecture.md)
Output: Refactored file

# Step 4: Add Missing Tests
Activate: Tester Agent

### Code Review Workflow

**Review a pull request:**

```bash
# Step 1: Determine PR Type
Read the PR description
Identify: Frontend? Backend? Security-sensitive? Performance-critical?

# Step 2: Activate Relevant Agents
For Frontend PR:
  → Reviewer Agent (always)
  → UI Agent (if visual changes)
  → UX Agent (if user flow changes)
  → A11y Agent (if new interactive elements)

For Backend PR:
  → Reviewer Agent (always)
  → Backend Agent (API/DB changes)
  → Security Agent (auth/data handling)

For Performance PR:
  → Reviewer Agent (always)
  → Performance Agent (bundle/render changes)

# Step 3: Consolidate Feedback
Combine all agent reports
Remove duplicates
Sort by severity: BLOCKING → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW

# Step 4: Request Changes or Approve
If BLOCKING issues exist → Request Changes
If only MEDIUM/LOW → Approve with suggestions

- Deploy to production
- Monitor
```

**When to use:** Every new feature, every sprint.

---

### 2. Code Review Workflow
**File:** `workflows/code-review.md`

**Process:**
```
1. Determine PR Type
   - Frontend? Backend? Full-stack?
   - Security-sensitive? Performance-critical?

2. Activate Relevant Agents
   Frontend PR:
   → Reviewer Agent (always)
   → UI Agent (visual changes)
   → UX Agent (user flow changes)
   → A11y Agent (interactive elements)
   → Performance Agent (bundle impact)

   Backend PR:
   → Reviewer Agent (always)
   → Backend Agent (API/DB changes)
   → Security Agent (auth/data handling)

3. Consolidate Feedback
   - Combine all agent reports
   - Remove duplicates
   - Sort by severity: BLOCKING → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW

4. Decision
   - BLOCKING issues? → Request Changes
   - Only MEDIUM/LOW? → Approve with suggestions
```

**When to use:** Every pull request before merge.

- What's the expected vs actual behavior?

Phase 2: ISOLATE
- Where does the error occur? (component, hook, service)
- What's the error message?
- What's the stack trace?

Phase 3: HYPOTHESIZE
- What could cause this?
- List 3-5 possible causes
- Rank by likelihood

Phase 4: TEST
- Test each hypothesis
- Use console.log, debugger, React DevTools
- Eliminate causes one by one

- Is it a minor bug? → MEDIUM (fix in next sprint)

7-Step Hotfix Protocol:

1. ASSESS (5 minutes)
   - Severity? Impact? Users affected?
   - Can we rollback? Or must we fix forward?

2. BRANCH (1 minute)
   - Create: hotfix/[issue-description]
   - Branch from: main (or last stable tag)

3. FIX (30-60 minutes)
   - Minimal change to fix the issue
   - No refactoring, no "while we're here"
   - Add test to prevent regression

4. EXPEDITED REVIEW (15 minutes)
   - Reviewer Agent (fast review)
   - Security Agent (if auth/data related)
   - One human reviewer approval

5. DEPLOY (10 minutes)
   - Deploy to staging
   - Quick smoke test
   - Deploy to production

6. VERIFY (15 minutes)
   - Test the fix in production
   - Monitor error rates
   - Verify metrics

7. POST-MORTEM (1 hour, within 24 hours)
   - What happened?

## 🏛️ The 5 Iron Laws

| # | Law | Meaning |
|---|-----|---------|
| 1 | ONE FILE = ONE RESPONSIBILITY | If you can't describe it in 5 words, split it |
| 2 | UI RENDERS DATA, NEVER CREATES IT | No business logic in components |
| 3 | MODULES ARE ISLANDS | Features never import from each other |
| 4 | SHOW SOMETHING INSTANTLY | Content visible within 100ms, always |
| 5 | EVERY INTERACTION HAS A RESPONSE | Silent UI is broken UI |
