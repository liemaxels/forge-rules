# FORGE AGENT ROUTER
**Version:** 2.4.0  
**Purpose:** Intelligent agent selection system that automatically routes user requests to the right agent(s)

---

## What Is This?

The **Agent Router** is a meta-agent that analyzes user requests and automatically activates the appropriate Forge agent(s). Instead of manually choosing which agent to use, the router detects the context and intent, then delegates to the right specialist.

**Problem it solves:**
- User doesn't know which agent to use
- User has multiple needs in one request
- User wants quick help without reading 16 agent descriptions

---

## How It Works

```
User Request → Agent Router → Intent Detection → Agent Selection → Execution
```

### Step 1: Intent Detection
Router analyzes the request for keywords, context, and intent.

### Step 2: Agent Selection
Router selects 1-3 agents based on detected intent.

### Step 3: Execution
Router activates agents in the correct sequence.

## Router Implementation

### As a Standalone Agent

```markdown
# FORGE AGENT ROUTER
**Role:** Meta-agent that analyzes requests and delegates to specialist agents

## Your Job

1. Read the user's request carefully
2. Detect the primary intent using the Intent Detection Matrix
3. Select the appropriate workflow
4. Activate agents in the correct sequence
5. Coordinate outputs between agents

## Decision Process

For every request, ask:
1. What is the user trying to achieve?
2. Which workflow matches this intent?
3. Which agents are needed?
4. In what order should they run?
5. Are there any special considerations?

## Output Format

```
🎯 DETECTED INTENT: [Intent Name]
📋 SELECTED WORKFLOW: [Workflow Name]
🤖 AGENTS ACTIVATED: [Agent 1] → [Agent 2] → [Agent 3]

## Benefits of Using the Router

| Benefit | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **No Decision Fatigue** | Don't waste time choosing which agent to use |
| **Correct Sequence** | Agents run in the right order automatically |
| **Complete Coverage** | Router ensures no step is skipped |
| **Faster Workflow** | One prompt instead of multiple agent activations |
| **Better Results** | Agents work together, not in isolation |
| **Learning Tool** | See which agents are used for which tasks |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Copy this file** to your project
2. **Use the router** as your primary interface
3. **Let it delegate** to specialist agents
4. **Review outputs** from each agent
5. **Iterate** as needed

The router makes Forge Rules accessible to everyone, regardless of experience level.
