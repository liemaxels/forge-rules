# FORGE AGENT SYSTEM
## The Complete AI Engineering Team
**version: 2.2.0 | Built on Forge Rules v2.0**

> One developer with the right agents moves faster than a traditional team of five.
> These agents don't just assist — they enforce standards, catch mistakes, and push output to its highest possible quality.

## QUICK REFERENCE

| Agent | File | When to Use |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 🎯 CEO | `agents/ceo.md` | Before any feature is designed |
| 🏗️ Architect | `agents/architect.md` | Before any code is written |
| 💻 Coder | `agents/coder.md` | When implementing any file |
| 🎨 UI | `agents/ui.md` | When building UI components |
| 🧭 UX | `agents/ux.md` | When designing user flows |
| 🔍 Reviewer | `agents/reviewer.md` | Before any PR merges |
| 🔒 Security | `agents/security.md` | For auth/data/API changes |
| 🧪 Tester | `agents/tester.md` | When writing or reviewing tests |
| ⚡ Performance | `agents/performance.md` | For optimization work |
| ♿ A11y | `agents/a11y.md` | For UI accessibility review |
| 🌐 Browser | `agents/browser.md` | For research and competitor analysis |
| 🖥️ Backend | `agents/backend.md` | For API design and backend code |
| 🚀 DevOps | `agents/devops.md` | For CI/CD and deployment setup |

## HOW TO ACTIVATE ANY AGENT

### Method 1 — Paste as System Instruction (Recommended)
Copy the entire content of the agent file and paste it as your AI's system instruction or custom instructions. The agent will be active for the entire conversation.

### Method 2 — Inline Activation
At the start of any message, say:
```
"Act as Forge [Agent Name] Agent. [Your request]"
```

### Method 3 — Kiro Skills
If using Kiro, place agent files in `.kiro/skills/forge-[agent-name]/SKILL.md`

---

## THE SPRINT WORKFLOW

Every feature follows this sequence:

```
1. THINK    → CEO Agent         → Product Brief
2. PLAN     → Architect Agent   → ARCHITECTURE.md
3. BUILD    → Coder Agent       → Working code
4. REVIEW   → Reviewer Agent    → Review report
5. TEST     → Tester Agent      → Test suite
6. SHIP     → Git workflow      → Merged PR
```

See `workflows/new-feature.md` for the complete workflow.

## AGENT INTERACTION RULES

### Rule 1 — Sequential, Not Parallel
Agents work in sequence. CEO before Architect. Architect before Coder. Never skip.

### Rule 2 — Output Feeds Input
Each agent's output is the next agent's input:
- CEO produces Product Brief → Architect reads it
- Architect produces ARCHITECTURE.md → Coder reads it
- Coder produces code → Reviewer reads it
- Reviewer produces report → Tester reads it

### Rule 3 — One File Per Coder Session
The Coder Agent builds ONE file per prompt. Never ask for multiple files at once.

### Rule 4 — Gates Are Real
Each workflow step has a gate. If the gate fails, fix it before proceeding. No exceptions.

### Rule 5 — Agents Challenge, Not Agree
Every agent is designed to push back, challenge assumptions, and find problems. If an agent is just agreeing with everything you say, you're not using it correctly.

## ANTI-SLOP ENFORCEMENT

These agents are specifically designed to prevent AI slop — the generic, mediocre output that AI produces when given no constraints.

**What causes AI slop:**
- Vague prompts ("build me a dashboard")
- No architectural constraints
- No quality standards
- No review process
- No testing requirements

**How Forge Agents prevent it:**
- CEO forces specificity before any code is written
- Architect enforces the 8-layer structure
- Coder enforces the 9-block component anatomy
- UI enforces the design token system
- UX enforces specific copy standards
- Reviewer catches every violation
- Security catches every vulnerability
- Tester proves the code works
- Performance proves it's fast
- A11y proves it's accessible

**The result:** Code that looks like it was written by a senior engineer, not generated by an AI.

## COST OPTIMIZATION

These agents are designed to be **model-agnostic and cost-efficient**:

| Approach | Cost | Quality |
|----------|------|---------|
| One massive prompt to GPT-4 | High | Medium (AI slop) |
| Forge Agent System | Low-Medium | High (enforced quality) |

**Why lower cost:**
- Each agent has a focused, specific job → shorter context → cheaper
- Structured output → less back-and-forth → fewer tokens
- Rules prevent mistakes → less rework → fewer total tokens
- One file per prompt → predictable, bounded cost

**Recommended model routing:**
- CEO, Architect, Reviewer: Use best available model (complex reasoning)
- Coder, UI, UX: Use mid-tier model (structured output, clear rules)
- Tester, Security, A11y: Use mid-tier model (checklist-based)
- Browser/Research: Use model with web access

## FORGE AGENT SYSTEM vs GSTACK

| | gstack | Forge Agent System |
|---|--------|-------------------|
| Platform | Claude Code + 10 agents | Any AI (Kiro, Claude, GPT, Gemini) |
| Format | TypeScript + Markdown | Pure Markdown |
| Install | git clone + ./setup | Copy-paste |
| Dependencies | Bun, Node.js, Playwright | None |
| Browser | Real Chromium browser | Research prompts |
| Focus | General software factory | Web app architecture specialist |
| Rules | Workflow-focused | Architecture + quality enforced |
| Cost | Free (but needs Claude Code) | Works with any model |

**Use gstack if:** You use Claude Code and want real browser automation.
**Use Forge Agents if:** You want architecture enforcement on any AI, any platform.

## GETTING STARTED

### For a new project:
```
1. Read: checklists/new-project.checklist.md
2. Activate: CEO Agent → describe your idea
3. Activate: Architect Agent → paste the Product Brief
4. Follow: workflows/new-feature.md
```

### For an existing project:
```
1. Activate: Architect Agent → "Audit this codebase against Forge Rules v2.0"
2. Activate: Reviewer Agent → "Review [specific file] against Forge Rules v2.0"
3. Fix violations in priority order: BLOCKING → HIGH → MEDIUM → LOW
```

### For a code review:
```
1. Follow: workflows/code-review.md
2. Activate agents in sequence based on PR type
```

### For debugging:
```
1. Follow: workflows/debug.md
2. Use the Debug Prompt Template
```

## PR TEMPLATES — WHICH ONE TO USE

There are two PR template files in this repository:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` | **Auto-loaded by GitHub** when you open a PR. Short version for quick use. |
| `templates/PR-description.template.md` | **Full version** with complete Master Rules checklist. Copy-paste manually for thorough reviews. |

**Rule:** Use `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` for all PRs. Use `templates/PR-description.template.md` when you need the extended checklist (major features, security-sensitive changes).
