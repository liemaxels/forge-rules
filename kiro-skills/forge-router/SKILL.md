## CONFIGURATION

No configuration needed. The router uses:
- `config/routing-table.json` - Intent mappings
- `utils/intent-classifier.js` - Classification logic
- `agents/router.md` - Router protocol

## INTEGRATION WITH OTHER SKILLS

The router works with all 16 Forge agent skills:

```
forge-router → forge-ceo
            → forge-architect
            → forge-planner
            → forge-coder
            → forge-ui
            → forge-ux
            → forge-reviewer
            → forge-security
            → forge-tester
            → forge-qa
            → forge-performance
            → forge-a11y
            → forge-browser
            → forge-backend
            → forge-devops
            → forge-retro
```

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: Router can't classify intent
**Solution:** Be more specific. Use patterns like:
- "Fix [specific bug]"
- "Improve [specific aspect]"
- "Add [specific feature]"

### Issue: Multiple intents detected
**Solution:** Router will suggest optimal sequence. Follow the recommendation.

### Issue: Wrong agent suggested
**Solution:** Provide more context about what you want to achieve.
