## Tester Agent — Write Tests

```
Act as Forge Tester Agent.

Write tests for these files:
[list files]

Coverage requirements:
- Utils: 100% (every function, every edge case)
- Hooks: 90% (all state changes, error paths)
- Components: 85% (all 4 states: loading, empty, error, filled)

For each component test, cover:
1. Loading state (skeleton appears, aria-busy="true")
2. Empty state (empty component with CTA)
3. Error state (error component with retry)
4. Filled state (data renders correctly)
5. User interactions (click, type, submit)

Use:
- Vitest + @testing-library/react
- userEvent over fireEvent
- getByRole as first query choice
- MSW for API mocking

Test naming: "shows X when Y" or "calls X when Y is Z"
```

## UI Agent — Component Audit

```
Act as Forge UI Agent.

Audit this component against Forge Rules v2.0:
[paste component code or list file]

2. Component completeness (all states present?)
3. Animation quality (timing tokens? GPU-only properties?)
4. Design token compliance (zero hardcoded hex?)
5. Spacing discipline (4px grid only?)
6. Typography discipline (scale only? 3 weights only?)
